    <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
    <div id="main">
        <p>Hacks values people who do the following:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Be kind.</li>
            <li>Help others.</li>
            <li>Build cool things.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>The following code of conduct is <em>intentionally minimal</em>
                because Hacks is meant to be an unstructured community without strict rules.
            </strong></p>

        <p>Hacks is a community of friends.
            We ask you to be aware of the fact that conversations that may be appropriate within the context of a
            specific friendship or relationship with another Hacks member may be inappropriate in the Hacks
            space or in a group conversation with Hacks members you don't know well.
        </p>

        <p>Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other hacks members.
            Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for hacks.
        </p>

        <p>Hacks members violating these rules may be asked to leave the community at the sole discretion of the hacks
            board.</p>

        <p>Thank you for helping to make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.</p>
