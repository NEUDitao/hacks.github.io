title: Code of Conduct
---

Hacks values people who do the following:

 1. Be kind.
 2. Help others.
 3. Build cool things.

The following code of conduct is intentionally minimal because Hacks is meant to be an unstructured community without strict rules.

Hacks is a community of friends. We ask you to be aware of the fact that conversations that may be appropriate within the context of a specific friendship or relationship with another Hacks member may be inappropriate in the Hacks space or in a group conversation with Hacks members you don't know well.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other hacks members. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for hacks.

Hacks members violating these rules may be asked to leave the community at the sole discretion of the hacks board.

Thank you for helping to make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.

If you have any questions, please contact {% include emailaddr.html %}.

This Code of Conduct is based on the Recurse Center's [code of conduct](https://www.recurse.com/code-of-conduct).
